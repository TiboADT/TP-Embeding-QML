# TP-Embeding-QML


This practical work accompanies the Master-level course on Quantum Embedding (Quantum Machine Learning). The notebooks and helper modules in this folder let students explore how classical data can be encoded into qubit(s), visualize embeddings on the Bloch sphere, and run small experiments with simple parameterized circuits.

Contents
- `TP_embeding_Dec_2025.ipynb` — guided notebook with examples and visualizations of 1-qubit and simple multi-qubit embeddings, deformation functions and display helpers.
- `aide_TP.py` (imported by the notebook) — helper functions used to generate points, apply deformations and visualize embeddings (2D → Bloch sphere / 3D views).
